This datagrid is component for [Nette Framework](https://nette.org/).
After playing with [Nextras/datagrid](https://nextras.org/datagrid/docs/3.0/) and [contributte/datagrid](https://github.com/contributte/datagrid) I decided to create my own datagrid which is fully compatible with [Nittro js Framework](https://www.nittro.org/) which I prefer in Nette developing.

This datagrid was inspirated by nextras/datagrid and contributte/datagrid, so thanks for great job!

* Nette 3 (3.1)
